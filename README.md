Automatic Phase Selector using ESP32
The automatic phase selector is a device that automatically control the relay and couples a single-phase load to it. 
This is useful in areas where the power grid is unstable and the phases can often be unbalanced. 
The automatic phase selector will ensure that your load is always connected to the most stable phase, which will help to prevent power outages and damage to your equipment.
